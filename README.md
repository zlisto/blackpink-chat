## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string-here
PORT=3001 # (optional, default 3001)
```

**MongoDB Setup:**
- **Database name:** `blackpink_chat` (recommended, or use your own)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`
